# Traffic_Image_Classification

Traffic congestion seems to be at an all-time high. Machine Learning methods must be developed to help solve traffic problems.
 Analyze features extracted from tiny traffic images depicting different traffic-related objects to determine theirtype as one 
 of 14 classes, noted by integers 1-14: car, suv, small_truck, medium_truck, large_truck, pedestrian, bus, van, people, bicycle,
 and motorcycle, signal_green, signal_yellow, signal_red. The object classes are heavily imbalanced.
 For example, the training data contains 31,775 cars but only 280 motorcycles and 197 buses. Classes in the test data are similarly distributed.
 
 
 
 The training dataset consists of 100,000 records and the test dataset also consists of 100,000 records.
